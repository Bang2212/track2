This package is developed by many students in National Taiwan University, so it
may contain multiple models and many scripts in this package.  Generally
speaking, our approach includes two different author-matching algorithms,
'main1' and 'main2', and the outputs of these two algorithms would be merged
using post-processing scripts in 'merge'.  To simplify the usage, we integrate
all necessary process into a Makefile in the top directory, so users could
easily type 'make' to activate the whole process. Moreover, 'buff/main1.csv'
and 'buff/main2.csv' are results of these two algorithms respectively.
Besides, because our algorithm relies on some other open source libraries,
please read the following statements before you get started. The detail of
these methods will be introduced in the paper which will be published in mid July.

A. Package organization
    'main1' (One of our author matching algorithm)
    'main2' (The other author matching algorithm)
    'typo' (Scripts to detect and fix TYPO)
    'merge' (Scripts for merging the results of the above methods.)


B. Performance in KDD-Cup 2013(F1 score):
            | main1 | main2 | merge
public(20%) |0.99186|0.99071|0.99196
private(80%)|0.99198|0.99083|0.99202
                

C. Make a prediction step-by-step:
    1. Requirements and dependency:
        Our package are run under Ubuntu 10.04 and requires the following packages:
            1-1. Python2 (test with version 2.6.5)
            1-2. Python3 (test with version 3.3.1)
            1-3. Perl5 (test with version 5.10)
            1-4. Perl module Text::CSV
            1-5. Raw data (dataRev2.zip). The path of the zipped file should be 'track2'

    2. Run:
        Type 'make'.

    3. Result:
        The path of result file is 'final.csv'. Please notice that algorithm
        may take more than 1 hour to generate the output file.

D. Public resources used in this package:
    1. Chinese information for 'main1'. This information locate is used in Eastern and Western identification. 
        1-1. Chinese family name
            We have two list of Chinese family names. The smaller one, TW.raw,
            is the official romanization of first 100 common Chinese name in
            Taiwan. The larger one, CN.raw, including 506 common Chinese names and
            their romanization, is download from Wikipedia.
