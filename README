This package is developed at National Taiwan University
Our approach includes two different author-matching algorithms,
'main1' and 'main2', and the outputs of these two algorithms are merged
using post-processing scripts in 'merge' and 'typo'.  To simplify the usage, we integrate
all necessary processes into a Makefile in the top directory, so users could
easily type 'make' to activate the whole process. Moreover, 'buff/main1.csv'
and 'buff/main2.csv' are results of these two algorithms respectively.
Because our algorithm relies on some other open source libraries,
please read the following statements before you get started. The detail of
these methods will be introduced in the paper which will be published in mid July.

A. Package organization
    'main1' (One author matching algorithm)
    'main2' (Another author matching algorithm)
    'typo' (Scripts to detect and fix typos)
    'merge' (Scripts for merging the results of the above methods.)


B. Performance in KDD-Cup 2013(F1 score):
            | main1 | main2 | merge
public(20%) |0.99186|0.99071|0.99196
private(80%)|0.99198|0.99083|0.99202
                

C. Make a prediction step-by-step:
    1. Requirements and dependency:
        Our package are run under Ubuntu 10.04 and requires the following packages:
            1-1. Python2 (test with version 2.6.5)
            1-2. Python3 (test with version 3.3.1)
            1-3. Perl5 (test with version 5.10)
            1-4. Perl module Text::CSV
            1-5. Raw data (dataRev2.zip). The zipped file should be stored at the top directory of this package 

    2. Run:
        Type 'make'.

    3. Result:
        The result file is 'final.csv'. Please notice that algorithm
        may take more than 1 hour to generate the output file.

D. Public resources used. They are included in this package.
    1. Chinese information for 'main1'. This information is used for Eastern and Western name identification. 
        1-1. Chinese family name
            We have two list of Chinese family names. The smaller one, TW.raw,
            is the official romanization of first 100 common Chinese name in
            Taiwan. The larger one, CN.raw, including 506 common Chinese names and
            their romanization, is downloaded from Wikipedia.

        1-2. Korean family name
            KR.raw contains 20 common Korea first name and their romanization.

        1-4. Stop words
            We manually select around 45 words frequently appeared in both English and Chinese.
    2. Chinese information for 'main2'.
